## [2.3.0] - 2024-01-09

I have recently had some time to focus on this project again and have tried to clear up some issues
that have been opened.  The main change for this release is that it should now be CSP compliant!

### Added
- This CHANGELOG file
- Added CPS headers to both sample web projects

### Fixed
- `jQuery.InputMask` has been replaced with [`Inputmask`](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask) to fix CSP issues.
- `Bootstrap DropDown` has been replaced with [`Tempus Dominus`](https://github.com/Eonasdan/tempus-dominus) to fix CSP issues.

### Changed
- Reworked how pages were generated to be more in line with the way that Hangfire.Core is doing it.
- Changed how DateTime objects are passed to the API endpoint. They are now passed as UTC from the client and should passed to the Job's method as UTC.

### Removed
Since I was not able to make the original Cron Builder UI library work the way I believe that it should, I have removed it.
The ability to schedule recurring jobs based on Cron is __still available__, but the Cron Builder UI is no longer there.
I will look at adding it back sometime in the future, or feel free to submit a pull request with a __CSP compliant__ builder.

You can use an online Cron Expression Builder (examples below) to build the string that you can enter in the Management UI.
